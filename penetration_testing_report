Web Penetration Testing Report for OWASP Juice Shop
Executive Summary
Purpose of the Test and Brief Overview of Key Findings
The purpose of this penetration test is to assess the security posture of the OWASP Juice Shop application by identifying vulnerabilities in its web application. Key findings include:

Identification of the admin path through enumeration.
Successful brute-force attack on admin credentials.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the product search feature.
High-Level Impact and Critical Vulnerabilities
Admin Path Enumeration: The application exposes an unsecured admin path that can be discovered by an attacker.
Brute Force on Admin Credentials: The admin login page can be brute-forced due to weak password policies.
XSS in Product Search: The search input does not sanitize user input, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.
Summary of Recommendations
Implement strong authentication mechanisms and rate-limiting for the admin login.
Apply input sanitization and validation to prevent XSS attacks.
Secure the admin panel by restricting access based on IP or roles.
Scope and Methodology
Scope
The scope of this test includes the OWASP Juice Shop web application (hosted locally).

Approach
Testing Approach: Black-box testing, where no prior knowledge of the system was provided. We treated the application as an external attacker would.
Tools Used
Burp Suite: For intercepting and manipulating HTTP requests.
Gobuster: For directory brute-forcing to find hidden admin paths.
OWASP ZAP: Used to identify common vulnerabilities such as XSS.
Firefox: For manual testing and exploitation.
Vulnerability Findings
Critical Vulnerabilities
1. Admin Path Enumeration
Description: The admin panel can be discovered using a brute-force directory search tool (Gobuster) to find hidden paths.
Risk: High, as attackers could find and access sensitive admin functionality.
Potential Impact: Unauthorized access to the admin panel, leading to potential data manipulation or account compromises.
Evidence:
Screenshot of Gobuster output showing the /admin path.
HTTP response with a 200 OK status for /admin.
Remediation: Restrict access to admin paths using IP whitelisting or proper access control mechanisms.
2. Brute Force on Admin Credentials
Description: Weak login functionality for the admin panel allows brute-force attempts on the admin credentials.
Risk: High, as attackers can guess the admin credentials through repeated login attempts.
Potential Impact: Complete compromise of the admin account.
Evidence:
Screenshot of Burp Suite showing multiple failed login attempts with a dictionary wordlist.
Access to the admin panel after successful login.
Remediation: Implement strong passwords, CAPTCHA, or rate-limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Product Search
Description: The product search input does not sanitize user input, allowing for the execution of malicious JavaScript.
Risk: Medium, as this could allow attackers to steal cookies or perform actions on behalf of users.
Potential Impact: User data theft or unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in user.
Evidence:
Screenshot showing the injected XSS payload in the product search input and the resulting script execution.
Proof of concept code that injects the script.
Remediation: Implement input sanitization and encoding to prevent script execution in user inputs.
Exploitation and Attack Simulation
Tools and Techniques Used for Exploitation
Gobuster was used to discover hidden directories and admin paths.
Burp Suite was used for intercepting and analyzing HTTP requests, followed by brute-forcing admin credentials using a dictionary attack.
OWASP ZAP was used for identifying and exploiting the XSS vulnerability in the product search field.
Outcome and Impact of the Attack
Successfully identified the admin panel and gained access after brute-forcing the credentials.
Demonstrated a working XSS attack by injecting a script into the product search input, which executed when viewed by a user.
Conclusion
Summary of Security Posture Based on Findings
The OWASP Juice Shop web application is vulnerable to a variety of common attacks, including brute-forcing admin credentials, discovering sensitive admin paths through enumeration, and Cross-Site Scripting in user inputs.

Overall Risk Level and Next Steps for Remediation
Overall Risk Level: High, due to the ease with which the admin credentials can be brute-forced and the potential impact of XSS.
Next Steps: Immediate remediation actions include implementing strong password policies, rate-limiting login attempts, securing admin paths, and applying proper input validation to prevent XSS.
